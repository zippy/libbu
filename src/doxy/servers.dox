 * Libbu++ provides a comprehensive set of classes for creating any type of
 * server that you would like.  At the moment these are restricted to using
 * the Bu::Socket subclass of Bu::Stream, and therefore the INET socket
 * namespace.  This isn't much of a restriction, but hopefully it will be
 * lifted in the future.
