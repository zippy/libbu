 *@page howto_threading Making Applications Multi-threaded
 *
 * Libbu++ provides support for object oriented threading including full support
 * for inter-thread communication and safety devices such as mutexes,
 * conditions, and semaphores.  It even provides some of the basic foundation
 * classes in thread-safe versions that often add extra functionality and make
 * writing thread-safe programs as easy as could be.
 *
 * Threads in libbu++ are currently based on the posix model, but will hopefully
 * adopt other methods behind the scenes for compatability with other operating
 * systems.
